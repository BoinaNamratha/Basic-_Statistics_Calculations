# Basic-_Statistics_Calculations
This repository contains simple Python scripts to perform fundamental statistical operations such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation using Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries like math library and basic Python features.
# Features
1.Calculate the mean (average) of a dataset

2.Compute the median (middle value)

3.Find the mode (most frequent value(s))

4.Determine the range (max - min)

5.Calculate variance and standard deviation for measuring spread

# basic_statistics_calculations.py 

The main script with all the functions

# How it Works
The script:

Takes input from the user as a list of numbers (space-separated)

Computes and prints the mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation

# Example Testcase
1 -2 33 56 78 94 -50 -7

Output:

Mean of given data set is: 25.38 

Median of given data set is: 17.00

Mode of given data set is: 1 -2 33 56 78 94 -50 -7 

Range of given data set is: 144.00

Variance of given data set is: 2068.48 

Standard Deviation of given data set is: 45.48
